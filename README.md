# principia.ts

`principia.ts` represents an ongoing effort in learning the principles behind category theory and functional programming, as well as creating a correct and structured implementation of those principles. However, it is also aimed at being functional functional library (ðŸ™‚) with high-performance data types and powerful abstractions.

There are very few tests written as of yet. Use at your own risk!
